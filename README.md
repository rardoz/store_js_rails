# StoreJsRails - store.js exposes a simple API for cross browser local storage

Store.js exposes a simple API for cross browser local storage packaged for the Rails asset pipeline. Store.js was created by the awesome developer, [Marcus Westin](https://github.com/marcuswestin). You can take a look at the original repo hosted here [https://github.com/marcuswestin/store.js](https://github.com/marcuswestin/store.js).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'store_js_rails'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install store_js_rails

Add it to your Javascript manifest file

    //= require store.min

## Usage

Check out the store js repo [https://github.com/marcuswestin/store.js](https://github.com/marcuswestin/store.js).

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
